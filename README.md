Problem Statement:

Develop an advanced and responsive Tableau dashboard for the Breaking Bad web series, 
offering a unique and insightful exploration of each episode.
The primary focus is on the dynamic representation of key episode-specific metrics, including season, rating, release date, 
IMDb rating, US viewership, and viewer ratings, with the ability for users to select and explore individual episodes. 
In addition to these dynamic metrics, the dashboard will feature static visualizations, such as a Lolipop chart depicting episodes by season, 
a Word Cloud showcasing directors' prominence by episodes, a Layered Pie Chart visualizing episodes by seasons and their corresponding durations,
an Area Chart presenting US viewership in millions over the years, and a Box Chart illustrating IMDb ratings by seasons.
